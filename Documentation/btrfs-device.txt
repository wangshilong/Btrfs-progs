SYNOPSIS
--------
'btrfs device' <subcommand> <args>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'btrfs device' is used to control the btrfs devices, since btrfs can be used
across several devices, 'btrfs device' is used for multiple device management.

SUBCOMMAND
----------
'add' [-Kf] <dev> [<dev>...] <path>::
Add device(s) to the filesystem identified by <path>.
+
If applicable, a whole device discard (TRIM) operation is performed.

'scan' [(--all-devices|-d)|<device> [<device>...]]::
Scan devices for a btrfs filesystem.
+
If one or more devices are passed, these are scanned for a btrfs filesystem. 
If no devices are passed, btrfs uses block devices containing btrfs
filesystem as listed by blkid.
Finally, if '--all-devices' or '-d' is passed, all the devices under /dev are 
scanned.

'disk-usage' [-b] <path> [<path>..]::
Show which chunks are in a device.
+
If '-b' is given, byte will be set as unit.

'ready' <device>::
Check device to see if it has all of it's devices in cache for mounting.

'stats' [-z] <path>|<device>::

identified by <path> or for a single <device>.
+
`Options`
+
-z::::
Reset stats to zero after reading them.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
'btrfs device' returns a zero exist status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.
